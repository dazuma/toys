    # Prepares the tool corresponding to the given command line, but instead of
    # running it, yields the execution context to the given block. This can be
    # used to test individual methods in a tool.
    #
    # By default, a single CLI is shared among the tests in each test class or
    # _describe_ block. Thus, tools are loaded only once, and the loader is
    # shared across the tests. If you need to isolate loading for a test,
    # create a separate CLI and pass it in using the `:cli` keyword argument.
    #
    # Note: this method runs the given block in-process. This means you can
    # test assertions within the block, but any input or output performed by
    # the tool's methods that you call, will manifest during your test. If this
    # is a problem, you might consider redirecting the standard streams when
    # calling this method, for example by using
    # [capture_subprocess_io](https://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/Minitest/Assertions.html#method-i-capture_subprocess_io).

    # block is given, the output and error streams are captured and the input
    # stream is closed.
