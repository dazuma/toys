# Release History

### 0.10.0 / 2020-02-24

* ADDED: `:bundler` mixin that installs and sets up a bundle for the tool
* ADDED: `bundler` options in the standard templates, to run those tools in a bundle
* ADDED: `subtool_apply` directive which applies a block to all subtools.
* ADDED: Add `.lib` directories to the Ruby load path when executing a tool.
* ADDED: `toys_version?` and `toys_version!` directives that check against version requirements.
* ADDED: `exec_separate_tool` and `capture_separate_tool` methods in the `:exec` mixin, to support executing tools in a separate process without forking
* IMPROVED: `long_desc` directive can now read the description from a text file.
* IMPROVED: The `tool` directive can take delimited strings as tool names.
* IMPROVED: Subtool blocks aren't actually executed unless the tool is needed.
* CHANGED: Added `on_missing` and `on_conflict` arguments to `Toys::Utils::Gems` constructor (which also affects the `:gems` mixin), and deprecated `suppress_confirm` and `default_confirm`.
* CHANGED: Tightened `rdoc` template's default gem version to `~> 6.1.0`.
* FIXED: `rdoc` template crashed if any nonstandard options were given.
* FIXED: `rubocop` template would abort prematurely if standard streams were redirected.

### 0.9.4 / 2020-01-26

* FIXED: Crash in the loader when a non-ruby file appears in a toys directory

### 0.9.3 / 2020-01-05

* FIXED: `delegate_to` directive could crash if an overriding tool has already been defined.
* FIXED: A Ruby 2.7 warning when reporting a Toys file syntax error.

### 0.9.2 / 2020-01-03

* IMPROVED: Mixins can now take real keyword arguments, and will pass them on properly to `on_initialize` and `on_include` blocks.
* CHANGED: `Toys::Utils::Exec` and the `:exec` mixin methods now take real keyword arguments rather than an `opts` hash. This means you should use keywords (or the double-splat operator) to avoid a deprecation warning on Ruby 2.7.

### 0.9.1 / 2019-12-22

* IMPROVED: `delegate_to` and `alias_tool` can take symbols as well as strings.
* DOCS: Fixed user guide internal links on rubydoc.info.

### 0.9.0 / 2019-12-02

* ADDED: The `delegate_to` directive causes the tool to delegate execution to another tool. This means it takes the same arguments and has the same execution behavior.
* ADDED: The `delegate_to` argument to the `tool` directive causes the tool to delegate to another tool. (Note: the `alias_tool` directive is now just shorthand for creating a tool with a delegate, and as such is mildly deprecated.)
* ADDED: The `current_tool` function can be called from the DSL to get the current `Toys::Tool` object.
* ADDED: The `:e` option is now an alias for `:exit_on_nonzero_status`.
* IMPROVED: `alias_tool` is now just shorthand for delegating. This means, aliases can now point to namespaces and will resolve subtools of their targets, and they now support tab completion and online help.
* IMPROVED: This release of Toys is now compatible with Ruby 2.7.0-preview3. It fixes some Ruby 2.7 specific bugs, and sanitizes keyword argument usage to eliminate Ruby 2.7 warnings.
* IMPROVED: JRuby is now supported for most operations. However, JRuby is generally not recommended because of JVM boot latency, lack of Kernel#fork support, and other issues.
* FIXED: The the `tool` directive no longer crashes if not passed a block.

### 0.8.1 / 2019-11-19

* FIXED: Listing subtools would crash if a broken alias was present.
* DOCUMENTATION: Switched from redcarpet to kramdown, and tried to make some structural fixes.

### 0.8.0 / 2019-06-20

This is a major update with significant new features and a bunch of fixes.
It does include a few minor backward-incompatible changes. All signifiant
features planned for beta are now implemented.

Highlights:

* Tab completion is available for Bash! See the README for instructions on installing it. Tab completion covers tool names, flags, flag values, and positional arguments. Tools can also customize the completion for their own flag and argument values.
* Toys now integrates with `did_you_mean` to provide suggestions for misspelled tools, flags, and arguments (when run on Ruby 2.4 or later.)
* Tools can now provide their own interrupt handler to respond to user `CTRL-C`. And the default handler no longer displays an unsightly stack trace. Tools can also provide their own handler for usage errors.
* A new argument parsing engine, supporting additional features such as optional enforcing that flags appear before positional arguments, as well as a bunch of fixes, especially around acceptors and optional flag values.
* Changed the license from BSD to MIT to better match how most libraries in the Ruby community are licensed.

Details:

* CHANGED: Relicensed under the MIT License.
* CHANGED: Requires Ruby 2.3 or later.
* ADDED: Tab completion for bash. Args and flags can provide their own completion information.
* ADDED: The usage error screen displays alternative suggestions when an argument is misspelled. (Requires Ruby 2.4 or later.)
* ADDED: Tools can provide an interrupt handler.
* ADDED: Tools can enforce that flags must be given before positional args. In particular, `toys do` now uses this feature, which eliminates most of the need to use `--` to get flags to work for subtools.
* ADDED: Tools can control whether their flags can be invoked by partial matches.
* ADDED: Function and range based acceptors.
* ADDED: Flag handlers can accept the symbolic names `:set` and `:push` for common cases.
* ADDED: The `:gem_build` template includes an `:install_gem` option. It also allows customization of gem output path.
* ADDED: The `acceptor` directive takes an optional `type_desc` argument.
* ADDED: The `accept` directives under flag and positional arg blocks in the DSL can now take blocks and `type_desc` values.
* ADDED: Context keys `UNMATCHED_ARGS`, `UNMATCHED_POSITIONAL`, and `UNMATCHED_FLAGS` that provide arguments that were not handled during arg parsing.
* ADDED: The Exec util and mixin support specifying a callback for process results.
* ADDED: The Exec util and mixin provide a way to identify processes by name.
* CHANGED: Toys now implements its own argument parsing and standard acceptors rather than relying on OptionParser. For the most part, OptionParser behavior is preserved, except in cases where there is clearly a bug.
* CHANGED: Flags create a short form flag by default if the name has one character.
* CHANGED: Flags with explicit value-less syntax are no longer given a value even if they specify a default or an acceptor.
* CHANGED: Renamed the `TOOL_DEFINITION` context key to `TOOL`, and removed the `tool_definition` convenience method.
* CHANGED: Removed the `BINARY_NAME` and `LOADER` context keys, and removed and the corresponding convenience methods. Get these values from the CLI if needed.
* CHANGED: Renamed the `USAGE_ERROR` context key to `USAGE_ERRORS`, and the corresponding convenience method to `usage_errors`. The value is now a (possibly empty) array of `Toys::ArgParser::UsageError` objects rather than a string that isn't machine-parseable.
* CHANGED: The root tool no longer defines remaining_args.
* CHANGED: Renamed `to_expand` to `on_expand` in template definitions.
* CHANGED: Renamed `to_initialize` to `on_initialize`, and `to_include` to `on_include` in mixin definitions.
* CHANGED: Default descriptions for flag groups is now handled by the `set_default_descriptions` middleware rather than hard-coded in FlagGroup.
* CHANGED: Exec reports failure to start processes in the result object rather than, e.g. raising ENOENT.
* IMPROVED: Toys no longer displays a stack trace if a tool is interrupted.
* IMPROVED: Error messages for flag groups are more complete.
* IMPROVED: All context data, including well-known data, is available to be modified by flags and args.
* FIXED: Flags with optional values are properly set to `true` (rather than left at `nil`) if no value is provided.
* FIXED: Prevented toys-core from being ousted from the load path if a toys file invoked bundler setup.
* FIXED: Acceptors no longer raise errors when run on missing optional values.
* FIXED: When reporting errors in toys files, the line number was off by 2.
* FIXED: The `--usage` help flag now honors `--all` and `--no-recursive`.
* FIXED: The terminal now handles nil streams, as advertised.

Additionally, a significant amount of internal reorganization and cleanup happened in the toys-core gem. See the changelog for toys-core for more details.
