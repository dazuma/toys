<p>Toys-Release is a Ruby library release system built on GitHub Actions and the
Toys gem. It interprets <a href="https://conventionalcommits.org/">conventional commit</a>
message format to automate changelog generation and library version updating
based on semantic versioning, and supports fine tuning and approval of releases
using GitHub pull requests.</p>

<p>Out of the box, Toys-Release knows how to tag GitHub releases, build and push
gems to RubyGems, and build and publish documentation to gh-pages. You can also
customize the build pipeline and many aspects of its behavior.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Toys-Release is desigend to be installed on a GitHub repository. This
installation consists of a set of GitHub Actions workflows, a configuration
file, and a GitHub Actions secret for your RubyGems credentials.</p>

<p>Once installed, Toys-Release provides command line tools and GitHub Actions
workflows for performing and managing releases. These tools are built atop the
Toys framework.</p>

<h3 id="the-toys-release-process">The Toys release process</h3>

<p>Releases using Toys-Release will generally look like the following.</p>

<p>When you are ready to do a release, go to the GitHub Action tab on your
repository and trigger the &quot;Open Release Request&quot; action. (Alternately, you can
run this action on the command line.) This action analyzes your repository,
finding changes that were committed since the last release. If those commit
messages were formatted properly with Conventional Commit tags, the action will
be able to generate a new entry in your changelog, and suggeset a proper
version for the new release in line with Semantic Versioning. It will then open
a pull request with the version update and changelog addition.</p>

<p>You can then review this pull request and modify it if you want to alter the
version to be released, or the changelog text. Once you are satisfied, merge
the pull request. Toys-Release will then automatically perform the release,
tagging it in GitHub and building and pushing a new Ruby gem release. It can
also be configured to build your gem&#39;s documentation and push it to your
repository&#39;s gh-pages branch for publication. You can cancel the release simply
by closing the pull request without merging.</p>

<h3 id="key-features">Key features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Tight integration with GitHub Actions provides a convenient workflow for
GitHub-based projects.</li>
<li>Automatically generates changelogs based on Conventional Commit messages.</li>
<li>Automatically proposes releases with semver-aligned version increments based
on the semantics implied by the commit messages.</li>
<li>Approve and adjust releases and changelogs by editing pull requests.</li>
<li>Automatic pre-release checks verify that CI passes and release status is
consistent.</li>
<li>Fix and retry failed releases via GitHub Actions or command line.</li>
<li>Supports single-library repositories and multi-library monorepos.</li>
<li>Support for groups of libraries that must be released together.</li>
<li>Support for publishing reference documentation to gh-pages.</li>
<li>Fine-grained configuration of the release pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h3>

<p>Toys-Release requires Ruby 2.7 or later, and Toys 0.18 or later. We recommend
the latest version of the standard C implementation of Ruby. (JRuby or
TruffleRuby <em>may</em> work, but are unsupported.) The Ruby provided by the standard
<code>setup-ruby</code> GitHub Action is sufficient.</p>
