module Toys
  ##
  # This is the base class for tool execution. It represents `self` when your
  # tool's methods (such as `run`) are called, and it defines the methods that
  # can be called by your tool (such as {#logger} and {#exit}.)
  #
  # This class also manages the "data" available to your tool when it runs.
  # This data is a hash of key-value pairs. It consists of values set by flags
  # and arguments defined by the tool, plus some "well-known" values such as
  # the logger and verbosity level.
  #
  # You can obtain a value from the data using the {Toys::Context#get} method.
  # Additionally, convenience methods are provided for many of the well-known
  # keys. For instance, you can call {Toys::Context#verbosity} to obtain the
  # value for the key {Toys::Context::Key::VERBOSITY}. Finally, flags and
  # positional arguments that store their data here will also typically
  # generate convenience methods. For example, an argument with key `:abc` will
  # add a method called `abc` that you can call to get the value.
  #
  # By convention, flags and arguments defined by your tool should use strings
  # or symbols as keys. Keys that are not strings or symbols should either be
  # well-known keys such as {Toys::Context::Key::VERBOSITY}, or should be used
  # for internal private information needed by middleware and mixins. The
  # module {Toys::Context::Key} defines a number of well-known keys as
  # constants.
  #
  class Context
    ##
    # Well-known context keys.
    #
    # This module is mixed into the runtime context. This means you can
    # reference any of these constants directly from your run method.
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     tool "my-name" do
    #       def run
    #         # TOOL_NAME is available here.
    #         puts "My name is #{get(TOOL_NAME)}"
    #       end
    #     end
