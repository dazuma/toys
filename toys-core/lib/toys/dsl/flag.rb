    # DSL for a flag definition block. Lets you set flag attributes in a block
    # instead of a long series of keyword arguments.
    #
    # These directives are available inside a block passed to
    # {Toys::DSL::Tool#flag}.
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     tool "mytool" do
    #       flag :value do
    #         # The directives in here are defined by this class
    #         flags "--value=VAL"
    #         accept Integer
    #         desc "An integer value"
    #       end
    #       # ...
    #     end

      # Add flags in OptionParser format. This may be called multiple times,
      # and the results are cumulative.
      #
      # Following are examples of valid syntax.
      #
      #  *  `-a` : A short boolean switch. When this appears as an argument,
      #     the value is set to `true`.
      #  *  `--abc` : A long boolean switch. When this appears as an argument,
      #     the value is set to `true`.
      #  *  `-aVAL` or `-a VAL` : A short flag that takes a required value.
      #     These two forms are treated identically. If this argument appears
      #     with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached string (e.g.
      #     `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the following argument
      #     is taken as the value (e.g. for `-a foo`, the value is set to
      #     `"foo"`.) The following argument is treated as the value even if it
      #     looks like a flag (e.g. `-a -a` causes the string `"-a"` to be
      #     taken as the value.)
      #  *  `-a[VAL]` : A short flag that takes an optional value. If this
      #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached
      #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the value
      #     is set to `true`. The following argument is never interpreted as
      #     the value. (Compare with `-a [VAL]`.)
      #  *  `-a [VAL]` : A short flag that takes an optional value. If this
      #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached
      #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, if the
      #     following argument does not look like a flag (i.e. it does not
      #     begin with a hyphen), it is taken as the value. (e.g. `-a foo`
      #     causes the string `"foo"` to be taken as the value.). If there is
      #     no following argument, or the following argument looks like a flag,
      #     the value is set to `true`. (Compare with `-a[VAL]`.)
      #  *  `--abc=VAL` or `--abc VAL` : A long flag that takes a required
      #     value. These two forms are treated identically. If this argument
      #     appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the attached
      #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the
      #     following argument is taken as the value (e.g. for `--abc foo`, the
      #     value is set to `"foo"`.) The following argument is treated as the
      #     value even if it looks like a flag (e.g. `--abc --abc` causes the
      #     string `"--abc"` to be taken as the value.)
      #  *  `--abc[=VAL]` : A long flag that takes an optional value. If this
      #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the
      #     attached string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise,
      #     the value is set to `true`. The following argument is never
      #     interpreted as the value. (Compare with `--abc [VAL]`.)
      #  *  `--abc [VAL]` : A long flag that takes an optional value. If this
      #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the
      #     attached string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, if
      #     the following argument does not look like a flag (i.e. it does not
      #     begin with a hyphen), it is taken as the value. (e.g. `--abc foo`
      #     causes the string `"foo"` to be taken as the value.). If there is
      #     no following argument, or the following argument looks like a flag,
      #     the value is set to `true`. (Compare with `--abc=[VAL]`.)
      #  *  `--[no-]abc` : A long boolean switch that can be turned either on
      #     or off. This effectively creates two flags, `--abc` which sets the
      #     value to `true`, and `--no-abc` which sets the falue to `false`.

      ##
      # Set the short description for the current flag. The short description
      # is displayed with the flag in online help.
      #
      # The description is a {Toys::WrappableString}, which may be word-wrapped
      # when displayed in a help screen. You may pass a {Toys::WrappableString}
      # directly to this method, or you may pass any input that can be used to
      # construct a wrappable string:
      #
      #  *  If you pass a String, its whitespace will be compacted (i.e. tabs,
      #     newlines, and multiple consecutive whitespace will be turned into a
      #     single space), and it will be word-wrapped on whitespace.
      #  *  If you pass an Array of Strings, each string will be considered a
      #     literal word that cannot be broken, and wrapping will be done
      #     across the strings in the array. In this case, whitespace is not
      #     compacted.
      #
      # ## Examples
      #
      # If you pass in a sentence as a simple string, it may be word wrapped
      # when displayed:
      #
      #     desc "This sentence may be wrapped."
      #
      # To specify a sentence that should never be word-wrapped, pass it as the
      # sole element of a string array:
      #
      #     desc ["This sentence will not be wrapped."]
      #
      # @param desc [String,Array<String>,Toys::WrappableString]
      # @return [self]
      #
      def desc(desc)

      # Add to the long description for the current flag. The long description
      # is displayed with the flag in online help. This directive may be given
      # multiple times, and the results are cumulative.
      #
      # A long description is a series of descriptions, which are generally
      # displayed in a series of lines/paragraphs. Each individual description
      # uses the form described in the {#desc} documentation, and may be
      # word-wrapped when displayed. To insert a blank line, include an empty
      # string as one of the descriptions.
      #
      # ## Example
      #
      #     long_desc "This initial paragraph might get word wrapped.",
      #               "This next paragraph is followed by a blank line.",
      #               "",
      #               ["This line will not be wrapped."],
      #               ["    This indent is preserved."]
      #     long_desc "This line is appended to the description."
      #
      # @param long_desc [String,Array<String>,Toys::WrappableString...]
      # @return [self]
