module Toys
  module StandardMixins
    ##
    # A set of helper methods for invoking subcommands. Provides shortcuts for
    # common cases such as invoking Ruby in a subprocess or capturing output
    # in a string. Also provides an interface for controlling a spawned
    # process's streams.
    #
    # You may make these methods available to your tool by including the
    # following directive in your tool configuration:
    #
    #     include :exec
    #
    # This is a frontend for {Toys::Utils::Exec}. More information is
    # available in that class's documentation.
    #
    # ## Features
    #
    # ### Controlling processes
    #
    # A process can be started in the *foreground* or the *background*. If you
    # start a foreground process, it will "take over" your standard input and
    # output streams by default, and it will keep control until it completes.
    # If you start a background process, its streams will be redirected to null
    # by default, and control will be returned to you immediately.
    #
    # When a process is running, you can control it using a
    # {Toys::Utils::Exec::Controller} object. Use a controller to interact with
    # the process's input and output streams, send it signals, or wait for it
    # to complete.
    #
    # When running a process in the foreground, the controller will be yielded
    # to an optional block. For example, the following code starts a process in
    # the foreground and passes its output stream to a controller.
    #
    #     exec(["git", "init"], out: :controller) do |controller|
    #       loop do
    #         line = controller.out.gets
    #         break if line.nil?
    #         puts "Got line: #{line}"
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # When running a process in the background, the controller is returned from
    # the method that starts the process:
    #
    #     controller = exec_service.exec(["git", "init"], background: true)
    #
    # ### Stream handling
    #
    # By default, subprocess streams are connected to the corresponding streams
    # in the parent process. You can change this behavior, redirecting streams
    # or providing ways to control them, using the `:in`, `:out`, and `:err`
    # options.
    #
    # Three general strategies are available for custom stream handling. First,
    # you may redirect to other streams such as files, IO objects, or Ruby
    # strings. Some of these options map directly to options provided by the
    # `Process#spawn` method. Second, you may use a controller to manipulate
    # the streams programmatically. Third, you may capture output stream data
    # and make it available in the result.
    #
    # Following is a full list of the stream handling options, along with how
    # to specify them using the `:in`, `:out`, and `:err` options.
    #
    #  *  **Inherit parent stream:** You may inherit the corresponding stream
    #     in the parent process by passing `:inherit` as the option value. This
    #     is the default if the subprocess is *not* run in the background.
    #  *  **Redirect to null:** You may redirect to a null stream by passing
    #     `:null` as the option value. This connects to a stream that is not
    #     closed but contains no data, i.e. `/dev/null` on unix systems. This
    #     is the default if the subprocess is run in the background.
    #  *  **Close the stream:** You may close the stream by passing `:close` as
    #     the option value. This is the same as passing `:close` to
    #     `Process#spawn`.
    #  *  **Redirect to a file:** You may redirect to a file. This reads from
    #     an existing file when connected to `:in`, and creates or appends to a
    #     file when connected to `:out` or `:err`. To specify a file, use the
    #     setting `[:file, "/path/to/file"]`. You may also, when writing a
    #     file, append an optional mode and permission code to the array. For
    #     example, `[:file, "/path/to/file", "a", 0644]`.
    #  *  **Redirect to an IO object:** You may redirect to an IO object in the
    #     parent process, by passing the IO object as the option value. You may
    #     use any IO object. For example, you could connect the child's output
    #     to the parent's error using `out: $stderr`, or you could connect to
    #     an existing File stream. Unlike `Process#spawn`, this works for IO
    #     objects that do not have a corresponding file descriptor (such as
    #     StringIO objects). In such a case, a thread will be spawned to pipe
    #     the IO data through to the child process.
    #  *  **Combine with another child stream:** You may redirect one child
    #     output stream to another, to combine them. To merge the child's error
    #     stream into its output stream, use `err: [:child, :out]`.
    #  *  **Read from a string:** You may pass a string to the input stream by
    #     setting `[:string, "the string"]`. This works only for `:in`.
    #  *  **Capture output stream:** You may capture a stream and make it
    #     available on the {Toys::Utils::Exec::Result} object, using the
    #     setting `:capture`. This works only for the `:out` and `:err`
    #     streams.
    #  *  **Use the controller:** You may hook a stream to the controller using
    #     the setting `:controller`. You can then manipulate the stream via the
    #     controller. If you pass a block to {Toys::StandardMixins::Exec#exec},
    #     it yields the {Toys::Utils::Exec::Controller}, giving you access to
    #     streams.
    #
    # ### Result handling
    #
    # A subprocess result is represented by a {Toys::Utils::Exec::Result}
    # object, which includes the exit code, the content of any captured output
    # streams, and any exeption raised when attempting to run the process.
    # When you run a process in the foreground, the method will return a result
    # object. When you run a process in the background, you can obtain the
    # result from the controller once the process completes.
    #
    # The following example demonstrates running a process in the foreground
    # and getting the exit code:
    #
    #     result = exec(["git", "init"])
    #     puts "exit code: #{result.exit_code}"
    #
    # The following example demonstrates starting a process in the background,
    # waiting for it to complete, and getting its exit code:
    #
    #     controller = exec(["git", "init"], background: true)
    #     result = controller.result(timeout: 1.0)
    #     if result
    #       puts "exit code: #{result.exit_code}"
    #     else
    #       puts "timed out"
    #     end
    #
    # You can also provide a callback that is executed once a process
    # completes. This callback can be specified as a method name or a `Proc`
    # object, and will be passed the result object. For example:
    #
    #     def run
    #       exec(["git", "init"], result_callback: :handle_result)
    #     end
    #     def handle_result(result)
    #       puts "exit code: #{result.exit_code}"
    #     end
    #
    # Finally, you can force your tool to exit if a subprocess fails, similar
    # to setting the `set -e` option in bash, by setting the
    # `:exit_on_nonzero_status` option. This is often set as a default
    # configuration for all subprocesses run in a tool, by passing it as an
    # argument to the `include` directive:
    #
    #     include :exec, exit_on_nonzero_status: true
    #
    # ## Configuration Options
    #
    # A variety of options can be used to control subprocesses. These can be
    # provided to any method that starts a subprocess. You can also set
    # defaults by passing them as keyword arguments when you `include` the
    # mixin.
    #
    # Options that affect the behavior of subprocesses:
    #
    #  *  `:env` (Hash) Environment variables to pass to the subprocess.
    #     Keys represent variable names and should be strings. Values should be
    #     either strings or `nil`, which unsets the variable.
    #
    #  *  `:background` (Boolean) Runs the process in the background if `true`.
    #
    # Options related to handling results
    #
    #  *  `:result_callback` (Proc,Symbol) A procedure that is called, and
    #     passed the result object, when the subprocess exits. You can provide
    #     a `Proc` object, or the name of a method as a `Symbol`.
    #
    #  *  `:exit_on_nonzero_status` (Boolean) If set to true, a nonzero exit
    #     code will cause the tool to exit immediately with that same code.
    #
    #  *  `:e` (Boolean) A short name for `:exit_on_nonzero_status`.
    #
    # Options for connecting input and output streams. See the section above on
    # stream handling for info on the values that can be passed.
    #
    #  *  `:in` Connects the input stream of the subprocess. See the section on
    #     stream handling.
    #
    #  *  `:out` Connects the standard output stream of the subprocess. See the
    #     section on stream handling.
    #
    #  *  `:err` Connects the standard error stream of the subprocess. See the
    #     section on stream handling.
    #
    # Options related to logging and reporting:
    #
    #  *  `:logger` (Logger) Logger to use for logging the actual command. If
    #     not present, the command is not logged.
    #
    #  *  `:log_level` (Integer,false) Level for logging the actual command.
    #     Defaults to Logger::INFO if not present. You may also pass `false` to
    #     disable logging of the command.
    #
    #  *  `:log_cmd` (String) The string logged for the actual command.
    #     Defaults to the `inspect` representation of the command.
    #
    #  *  `:name` (Object) An optional object that can be used to identify this
    #     subprocess. It is available in the controller and result objects.
    #
    # In addition, the following options recognized by
    # [`Process#spawn`](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Process.html#method-c-spawn)
    # are supported.
    #
    #  *  `:chdir` (String) Set the working directory for the command.
    #
    #  *  `:close_others` (Boolean) Whether to close non-redirected
    #     non-standard file descriptors.
    #
    #  *  `:new_pgroup` (Boolean) Create new process group (Windows only).
    #
    #  *  `:pgroup` (Integer,true,nil) The process group setting.
    #
    #  *  `:umask` (Integer) Umask setting for the new process.
    #
    #  *  `:unsetenv_others` (Boolean) Clear environment variables except those
    #     explicitly set.
    #
    # Any other option key will result in an `ArgumentError`.

      # it explicitly for this method to work. Furthermore, Bundler, if

      # the behavior of the CLI, and the gem environment, might not be the same
      # as those of the calling tool.
