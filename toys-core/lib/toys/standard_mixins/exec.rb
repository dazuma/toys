    ##
    # A set of helper methods for invoking subcommands. Provides shortcuts for
    # common cases such as invoking Ruby in a subprocess or capturing output
    # in a string. Also provides an interface for controlling a spawned
    # process's streams.
    #
    # You may make these methods available to your tool by including the
    # following directive in your tool configuration:
    #
    #     include :exec
    #
    # This is a frontend for {Toys::Utils::Exec}. More information is
    # available in that class's documentation.
    #
    # ## Configuration Options
    #
    # Subprocesses may be configured using the options in the
    # {Toys::Utils::Exec} class. These include a variety of options supported
    # by `Process#spawn`, and some options supported by {Toys::Utils::Exec}
    # itself.
    #
    # You can set default configuration by passing options to the `include`
    # directive. For example, to log commands at the debug level for all
    # subprocesses spawned by this tool:
    #
    #     include :exec, log_level: Logger::DEBUG
    #
    # Two special options are also recognized by the mixin.
    #
    #  *  A **:result_callback** proc may take a second argument. If it does,
    #     the context object is passed as the second argument. This is useful
    #     if a `:result_callback` is applied to the entire tool by passing it
    #     to the `include` directive. In that case, `self` is not set to the
    #     context object as it normally would be in a tool's `run` method, so
    #     you cannot access it otherwise. For example, here is how to log the
    #     exit code for every subcommand:
    #
    #         tool "mytool" do
    #           callback = proc do |result, context|
    #             context.logger.info "Exit code: #{result.exit_code}"
    #           end
    #           include :exec, result_callback: callback
    #           # ...
    #         end
    #
    #     You may also pass a symbol as the `:result_callback`. The method with
    #     that name is then called as the callback. The method must take one
    #     argument, the result object.
    #
    #  *  If **:exit_on_nonzero_status** is set to true, a nonzero exit code
    #     returned by the subprocess will also cause the tool to exit
    #     immediately with that same code.
    #
    #     This is particularly useful as an option to the `include` directive,
    #     where it causes any subprocess failure to abort the tool, similar to
    #     setting `set -e` in a bash script.
    #
    #         include :exec, exit_on_nonzero_status: true
    #
    #     **:e** can be used as a shortcut for **:exit_on_nonzero_status**
    #
    #         include :exec, e: true
