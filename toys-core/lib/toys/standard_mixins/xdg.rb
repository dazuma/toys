    # A mixin that provides tools for working with the XDG Base Directory
    # Specification.
    #
    # This mixin provides an instance of {Toys::Utils::XDG}, which includes
    # utility methods that locate base directories and search paths for
    # application state, configuration, caches, and other data, according to
    # the [XDG Base Directory Spec version
    # 0.8](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/0.8/).
    #
    # @example
    #
    #   include :xdg
    #
    #   def run
    #     # Get config file paths, in order from most to least inportant
    #     config_files = xdg.lookup_config("my-config.toml")
    #     config_files.each { |path| read_my_config(path) }
    #   end
    #
    module XDG
