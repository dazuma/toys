# Toys is a configurable command line tool. Write commands in config files
# using a simple DSL, and Toys will provide the command line executable and
# take care of all the details such as argument parsing, online help, and error
# reporting. Toys is designed for software developers, IT professionals, and
# other power users who want to write and organize scripts to automate their
# workflows. It can also be used as a Rake replacement, providing a more
# natural command line interface for your project's build tasks.
#
# This module contains the command line framework underlying Toys. It can be
# used to create command line executables using the Toys DSL and classes.
#
# ## Common starting points
#
# Some of the most commonly needed class documentation is listed below:
#
# * For information on the DSL used to write tools, start with
#   {Toys::DSL::Tool}.
# * The base class for tool runtime (i.e. that defines the basic methods
#   available to a tool's implementation) is {Toys::Context}.
# * For information on writing mixins, see {Toys::Mixin}.
# * For information on writing templates, see {Toys::Template}.
# * For information on writing acceptors, see {Toys::Acceptor}.
# * For information on writing custom shell completions, see {Toys::Completion}.
# * Standard mixins are defined under the {Toys::StandardMixins} module.
# * Various utilities are defined under {Toys::Utils}. Some of these serve as
#   the implementations of corresponding mixins.
# * The main entrypoint for the command line framework is {Toys::CLI}.
#
# Other important internal classes are listed below.
#
# * The definition of a tool is represented by {Toys::ToolDefinition} along
#   the helpers {Toys::Flag}, {Toys::PositionalArg}, and {Toys::FlagGroup}.
# * Argument parsing is implemented by {Toys::ArgParser}.
# * The process of finding and loading a tool definition given a tool name, is
#   implemented by {Toys::Loader}.
# * Text wrapping is handled by {Toys::WrappableString}.
# * The settings system is implemented by {Toys::Settings}.
#
module Toys
  ##
  # Namespace for DSL classes. These classes provide the directives that can be
  # used in configuration files.
  #
  # DSL directives that can appear at the top level of Toys files and tool
  # blocks are defined by the {Toys::DSL::Tool} module.
  #
  # Directives that can appear within a block passed to {Toys::DSL::Tool#flag}
  # are defined by the {Toys::DSL::Flag} class.
  #
  # Directives that can appear within a {Toys::DSL::Tool#flag_group} block or
  # any of its related directives, are defined by the {Toys::DSL::FlagGroup}
  # class.
  #
  # Directives that can appear within a {Toys::DSL::Tool#required_arg},
  # {Toys::DSL::Tool#optional_arg}, or {Toys::DSL::Tool#remaining_args} block,
  # are defined by the {Toys::DSL::PositionalArg} class.
  #
  module DSL
  end

  ##
  # Namespace for standard middleware classes.
  #
  # These middleware are provided by Toys-Core and can be referenced by name
  # when creating a {Toys::CLI}.
  #
  module StandardMiddleware

    # @private
    #
    COMMON_FLAG_GROUP = :__common

    ##
    # @private
    #
    def self.append_common_flag_group(tool)
      tool.add_flag_group(type: :optional, name: COMMON_FLAG_GROUP,
                          desc: "Common Flags", report_collisions: false)
      COMMON_FLAG_GROUP
    end
  end

  ##
  # Namespace for standard mixin classes.
  #
  # These mixins are provided by Toys-Core and can be included by name by
  # passing a symbol to {Toys::DSL::Tool#include}.
  #
  module StandardMixins
  end

  ##
  # Namespace for common utility classes.
  #
  # These classes are not loaded by default, and must be required explicitly.
  # For example, before using {Toys::Utils::Exec}, you must:
  #
  #     require "toys/utils/exec"
  #
  module Utils
  end

  class << self
    ##
    # Path to the executable. This can, for example, be invoked to run a subtool
    # in a clean environment.
    #
    # @return [String] if there is an executable
    # @return [nil] if there is no such executable
    #
    attr_accessor :executable_path
  end
