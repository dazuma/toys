# Release History

### 0.10.0 / unreleased

* ADDED: `:bundler` mixin that installs and sets up a bundle for the tool
* ADDED: `bundle` method to `Toys::Utils::Gems` that performs bundler install and setup
* ADDED: `subtool_apply` directive which applies a block to all subtools.
* ADDED: `Toys::Tool#subtool_middleware_stack` allowing a tool to modify the middleware stack for its subtools.
* ADDED: The `Toys::Middleware::Stack` class represents a stack of middleware specs, and distinguishes the default set from those added afterward.
* ADDED: `exec_separate_tool` and `capture_separate_tool` methods in the `:exec` mixin, to support executing tools in a separate process without forking
* ADDED: `Toys.executable_path` attribute allowing an executable to provide the executable for running tools separately.
* ADDED: `Toys::CLI` now has a `logger_factory` property, to generate separate loggers per tool execution.
* IMPROVED: Middleware objects no longer have to respond to all middleware methods. If a method is not implemented, it is simply considered a nop.
* IMPROVED: `Toys::Utils::Terminal` is now thread-safe. 
* CHANGED: Added `on_missing` and `on_conflict` arguments to `Toys::Utils::Gems` constructor (which also affects the `:gems` mixin), and deprecated `suppress_confirm` and `default_confirm`.
* CHANGED: `Toys::Tool#middleware_stack` renamed to `Toys::Tool#built_middleware` to clarify that it is an array of middleware objects rather than specs.
* CHANGED: `Toys::CLI.default_logger` removed and replaced with `Toys::CLI.default_logger_factory`. In general, global loggers for CLI are now discouraged because they are not thread-safe.
* CHANGED: `Toys::Terminal#styled` is no longer mutable.

### 0.9.4 / 2020-01-26

* FIXED: Crash in the loader when a non-ruby file appears in a toys directory

### 0.9.3 / 2020-01-05

* FIXED: `delegate_to` directive could crash if an overriding tool has already been defined.
* FIXED: A Ruby 2.7 warning when reporting a Toys file syntax error.

### 0.9.2 / 2020-01-03

* IMPROVED: Mixins can now take real keyword arguments, and will pass them on properly to `on_initialize` and `on_include` blocks.
* CHANGED: `Toys::Utils::Exec` and the `:exec` mixin methods now take real keyword arguments rather than an `opts` hash. This means you should use keywords (or the double-splat operator) to avoid a deprecation warning on Ruby 2.7.
* IMPROVED: `Toys::CLI#clone` can be passed keyword arguments to modify the configuration.
* IMPROVED: `Toys::Loader` is now thread-safe. This means it is now possible for a single `Toys::CLI` to run multiple tools in different threads.
* IMPROVED: There is now a class for middleware specs, making possible a nicer syntax for building a middleware stack.

### 0.9.1 / 2019-12-22

* IMPROVED: `delegate_to` and `alias_tool` can take symbols as well as strings.

### 0.9.0 / 2019-12-02

Functional changes:

* ADDED: The `delegate_to` directive causes the tool to delegate execution to another tool. This means it takes the same arguments and has the same execution behavior.
* ADDED: The `delegate_to` argument to the `tool` directive causes the tool to delegate to another tool. (Note: the `alias_tool` directive is now just shorthand for creating a tool with a delegate, and as such is mildly deprecated.)
* ADDED: The `current_tool` function can be called from the DSL to get the current `Toys::Tool` object.
* ADDED: The `:e` option is now an alias for `:exit_on_nonzero_status`.
* IMPROVED: `alias_tool` is now just shorthand for delegating. This means, aliases can now point to namespaces and will resolve subtools of their targets, and they now support tab completion and online help.
* IMPROVED: This release of Toys is now compatible with Ruby 2.7.0-preview3. It fixes some Ruby 2.7 specific bugs, and sanitizes keyword argument usage to eliminate Ruby 2.7 warnings.
* IMPROVED: JRuby is now supported for most operations. However, JRuby is generally not recommended because of JVM boot latency, lack of Kernel#fork support, and other issues.
* FIXED: The `tool` directive no longer crashes if no block is provided.

Internal interface changes:

* REMOVED: The `Toys::Alias` class has been removed, along with relevant functionality in `Toys::Loader` including `Toys::Loader#make_alias`. Use tool delegation instead.
* CHANGED: Positional arguments to middleware specs must now be wrapped in an array.
* CHANGED: The `Toys::ArgParser` constructor takes a `default_data` argument instead of `verbosity`.
* CHANGED: Version constant is now `Toys::Core::VERSION`.
* CHNAGED: The `flag` argument to `Toys::Flag::DefaultCompletion#initialize` is now a required keyword argument.
* ADDED: `Toys::Tool#delegate_to` causes the tool to delegate to another tool.
* ADDED: The `Toys::Context::Key::DELEGATED_FROM` key provides the delegating context, if any.

### 0.8.1 / 2019-11-19

* FIXED: Listing subtools would crash if a broken alias was present.
* DOCUMENTATION: Switched from redcarpet to kramdown, and tried to make some structural fixes.

### 0.8.0 / 2019-06-20

This is a major update with significant new features and a bunch of fixes. It also includes a significant amount of internal reorganization and cleanup, some of which resulted in backward incompatible changes. Basic use should not be affected. All signifiant features planned for beta are now implemented.

Major changes and features:

* CHANGED: Relicensed under the MIT License.
* CHANGED: Requires Ruby 2.3 or later.
* ADDED: Tab completion for bash. Added APIs and DSL constructs for tools to customize completions.
* ADDED: The usage error screen displays suggestions when an argument is misspelled. (Requires Ruby 2.4 or later.)
* ADDED: Tools can provide an interrupt handler and a custom usage error handler. Added appropriate APIs and DSL methods.
* ADDED: Tools can enforce that flags must be given before positional args, and can control whether partial flags are accepted.

Other notable changes:

* ADDED: Flag handlers can accept the symbolic names `:set` and `:push` for common cases.
* ADDED: Function and range based acceptors.
* ADDED: The `acceptor` directive takes an optional `type_desc` argument.
* ADDED: The `accept` directives under flag and positional arg blocks in the DSL can now take blocks and `type_desc` values.
* ADDED: Context keys `UNMATCHED_ARGS`, `UNMATCHED_POSITIONAL`, and `UNMATCHED_FLAGS` that provide arguments that were not handled during arg parsing.
* ADDED: The Exec util and mixin support specifying a callback for process results.
* ADDED: The Exec util and mixin provide a way to identify processes by name.
* CHANGED: Implemented custom argument parsing and custom implementations of the standard OptionParser acceptors, rather than relying on OptionParser itself. For the most part, OptionParser behavior is preserved, except in cases where there is clearly a bug.
* CHANGED: Flags create a short form flag by default if the name has one character.
* CHANGED: Flags with explicit value-less syntax are no longer given a value if they specify a default or an acceptor.
* CHANGED: Renamed the `TOOL_DEFINITION` context key to `TOOL`, and removed the `tool_definition` convenience method.
* CHANGED: Removed the `BINARY_NAME` and `LOADER` context keys, and removed the corresponding convenience methods. Get these values from the CLI if needed.
* CHANGED: Renamed the `USAGE_ERROR` context key to `USAGE_ERRORS`, and the corresponding convenience method to `usage_errors`. The value is now a (possibly empty) array of `Toys::ArgParser::UsageError` objects rather than a string that isn't machine-parseable.
* CHANGED: The help middleware no longer defines remaining_args on the root tool.
* CHANGED: Renamed `to_expand` to `on_expand` in template definitions.
* CHANGED: Renamed `to_initialize` to `on_initialize`, and `to_include` to `on_include` in mixin definitions.
* CHANGED: The CLI options `preload_directory_name` and `data_directory_name` renamed to `preload_dir_name` and `data_dir_name`.
* CHANGED: Default descriptions for flag groups is now handled by the `set_default_descriptions` middleware rather than hard-coded in FlagGroup.
* CHANGED: Exec reports failure to start processes in the result object rather than, e.g. raising ENOENT.
* IMPROVED: Default error handler no longer displays a stack trace if a tool is interrupted.
* IMPROVED: Error messages for flag groups are more complete.
* IMPROVED: All context data, including well-known data, is available to be modified by flags and args.
* FIXED: Flags with optional values are properly set to `true` (rather than left at `nil`) if no value is provided.
* FIXED: Acceptors no longer raise errors when run on missing optional values.
* FIXED: When reporting errors in toys files, the line number was off by 2.
* FIXED: The `--usage` help flag now honors `--all` and `--no-recursive`.
* FIXED: The terminal now handles nil streams, as advertised.

Changes to internal interfaces:

* General changes:
    * CHANGED: Renamed `Toys::Tool` to `Toys::Context`, and the `Keys` submodule to `Key`.
    * CHANGED: Moved the `ModuleLookup` and `WrappableString` out of the `Utils` module to be located directly under `Toys`. Other modules remain under `Utils`.  The remaining files under "toys/utils" must now be required explicitly. This directory is now specifically for modules that are not part of the "core" interface.
    * CHANGED: All the classes under `Toys::Definition` are now located directly under `Toys`. For example, `Toys::Definition::Tool` is now `Toys::Tool`.
    * CHANGED: Generally removed the term "definition" from interfaces. For example, an accessor method called `tool_definition` is now just called `tool`.
    * CHANGED: Renamed `Toys::DSL::Arg` to `Toys::DSL::PositionalArg`
    * CHANGED: Removed `Toys::Runner` and folded its functionality into `Toys::CLI`.
    * CHANGED: The fallback execution feature of the show_help middleware is implemented by catching an exception afterward rather than detecting non-runnable up front. This lets us remove the second copy of show_help from the middleware stack.
    * ADDED: Functionality dependent on Ruby version is kept in `Toys::Compat`.
* Changes related to the tool classes:
    * CHANGED: Moved `Toys::Definition::Tool` to `Toys::Tool`.
    * CHANGED: Removed the term "definition" from accessors. Specifically `flag_definitions` renamed to `flags`, `required_arg_definitions` renamed to `required_args`, `optional_arg_definitions` renamed to `optional_args`, `remaining_args_definition` renamed to `remaining_arg`, and `arg_definitions` renamed to `positional_args`.
    * CHANGED: Renamed `Tool#runnable=` to `Tool#run_handler=`.
    * CHANGED: `Tool#add_acceptor` takes the name as a separate argument, for consistency with `add_mixin` and `add_template`.
    * CHANGED: Removed `Tool#custom_acceptors` method.
    * CHANGED: Removed `Tool#resolve_acceptor` and replaced with `lookup_acceptor` which only looks up names.
    * CHANGED: Renamed `Tool#resolve_mixin` to `lookup_mixin` and `Tool#resolve_template` to `lookup_template`.
    * ADDED: Added `resolve_flag` method to look up flags by syntax.
    * ADDED: Accessor for interrupt handler.
    * ADDED: `enforce_flags_before_args` setting and `flags_before_args_enforced?` query.
    * ADDED: Completion accessor, and options to the various flag and positional arg methods to set their completion strategies.
    * ADDED: Added `Tool::DefaultCompletion` class.
    * IMPROVED: `add_mixin`, `add_template`, and `add_acceptor` support all the specs understood by their create methods.
* Changes related to the flag classes:
    * CHANGED: Moved `Toys::Definition::Flag` to `Toys::Flag`
    * CHANGED: `FlagSyntax` is now `Flag::Syntax`.
    * CHANGED: `Flag::Syntax#flag_style` now has values `:short` and `:long` instead of `"-"` and `"--"`.
    * CHANGED: `Flag#single_flag_syntax` renamed to `Flag#short_flag_syntax`, and `Flag#double_flag_syntax` renamed to `Flag#long_flag_syntax`.
    * CHANGED: Renamed `Flag#accept` to `Flag#acceptor` which now always returns an acceptor object (even for well-known acceptors such as `Integer`).
    * CHANGED: Removed `Flag#optparser_info` and replaced with `Flag#canonical_syntax_strings`.
    * ADDED: `Flag#create` class method providing a sane construction interface.
    * ADDED: `Flag#resolve` method to look up flag syntax.
    * ADDED: `Flag#completion` field.
    * ADDED: Added `Flag::Resolution` and `Flag::DefaultCompletion` classes.
* Changes related to the positional arg classes:
    * CHANGED: Moved `Toys::Definition::Arg` to `Toys::PositionalArg`.
    * CHANGED: Renamed `Arg#accept` to `PositionalArg#acceptor` which now always returns an acceptor object (even for well-known acceptors such as `Integer`).
    * ADDED: `PositionalArg#create` class method providing a sane construction interface.
    * ADDED: `PositionalArg#completion` field
* Changes related to the flag group classes:
    * CHANGED: Moved `Toys::Definition::FlagGroup` to `Toys::FlagGroup`
    * CHANGED: The base class is now `FlagGroup::Base` instead of `FlagGroup` itself.
    * ADDED: `FlagGroup#create` class method providing a sane construction interface.
* Changes related to acceptors:
    * CHANGED: Moved `Toys::Definition::Acceptor` to `Toys::Acceptor`
    * CHANGED: The base ciass is now `Acceptor::Base` instead of `Acceptor` itself.
    * CHANGED: Subclasses are now submodules under `Acceptor`. For example, moved `Toys::Definition::PatternAcceptor` to `Toys::Acceptor::Pattern`.
    * CHANGED: Replaced `name` field with separate `type_desc` and `well_known_spec` fields.
    * CHANGED: The base class no longer takes a conversion proc. It is always a no-op. `Acceptor::Pattern`, however, does take a converter so it can continue to handle custom OptionParser acceptors.
    * ADDED: Acceptors may define `suggestions` which returns results from did-you-mean.
    * ADDED: Simple acceptor (`Acceptor::Simple`) which uses a single function to validate and convert input.
    * ADDED: Range acceptor (`Acceptor::Range`) which validates against a range.
    * ADDED: Class methods `Acceptor.create` and `Acceptor.lookup_well_known`.

### 0.7.0 / 2019-01-23

* ADDED: Flag groups, which enforce policies around which flags are required.
