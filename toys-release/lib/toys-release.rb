# Toys is a configurable command line tool. Write commands in config files
# using a simple DSL, and Toys will provide the command line executable and
# take care of all the details such as argument parsing, online help, and error
# reporting. Toys is designed for software developers, IT professionals, and
# other power users who want to write and organize scripts to automate their
# workflows. It can also be used as a Rake replacement, providing a more
# natural command line interface for your project's build tasks.
