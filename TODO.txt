# TODO items

This is a dumping ground of possible ideas and future directions for Toys.
These items are all tentative or under investigation. Finalized to-do items
are covered in github issues (https://github.com/dazuma/toys/issues).

## Ideas under investigation

* Evaluate options for closer Rails integration
* Tool archives for sharing/installing tools
* Should it be possible to set require_exact_flag_match per-flag?
* Convenience methods for creating pipes/splits/joins in exec
* Integrate with the "less" tool in exec.
* toys system new: Create toys files and gems
* toys system lint: Check toys file structure and practices
* Line length limit for Terminal
* Something to generate output formats
* Namespace clearing/locking
* Additional ways to find terminal size

## Other ideas we probably won't do

* toys system clean: Clean old installations of toys. Probably not a good idea because other versions may be in bundles.
* Customize the value to set when not providing a value to an optional-value flag. Probably not worth it since normal boolean flags are always set to `true`, and the handler can be used to customize it already.
