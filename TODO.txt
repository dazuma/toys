# TODO items

This is a dumping ground of possible ideas and future directions for Toys.
These items are all tentative or under investigation. Finalized to-do items
are covered in GitHub issues (https://github.com/dazuma/toys/issues).

## Ideas under investigation

* Allow override when doing data lookup (for subdirectory-specific configuration)
* Evaluate options for closer Rails integration
* Should it be possible to set require_exact_flag_match per-flag?
* toys system new: Create toys files and gems
* toys system lint: Check toys file structure and practices
* Line length limit for Terminal
* Generalized classes for generating output formats
* Namespace clearing/locking
* Additional ways to find terminal size (there's a gem for unicode line length)
* Should it be possible to auto-terminate an exec at the end of a controller block?
* Should toys-release auto-initialize gh-pages during the release pipeline?
